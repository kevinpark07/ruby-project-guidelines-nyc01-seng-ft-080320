# Mod1 Final Project: Harry Potter: The Definitive RPG Experience
Created by: Anson Nickel and Kevin Park, Flatiron School 2020

## Description

Harry Potter: The Definitive Experience provides the framwework to participate in the world of Harry Potter. A user will be able to take on multiple scenarios, using multiple combinations of items and spells from the Harry Potter universe. Yes, Butter Beer plays a starring role. Using the open Harry Potter API, our app imports all of the Harry Potter characters with attributes such as name, house, blood-type, and even if they're members of the Death Eaters, Dumbledore's Army, etc.

In our app, a user will be able to:

1. Create an account with the game, using a username and password combo.
2. Maintain that account through multiple play-throughs
3. Learn new spells
4. Acquire new items
5. Continuously change and update your selections
6. Try to successfully complete a chosen scenario
7. Retry scenarios using different combinations of spells/items

This is a working proto-type and the hope is add the following functions:

1. More scenarios
2. User can interact with the famous characters of Harry Potter prior to going on scenarios.
3. Add more robust character building elements (a la traditional RPG games)
